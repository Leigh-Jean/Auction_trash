# Auction_trash
Auction bidding program , where it should only display the highest  bid and the bidder's name.
Will remove this after a while , as it is part of a course that I'm doing but battling to get it figured out.
Need to figure out how I am going to be able to print and present the "key" and corresponding  highest "value" from the looped dictionary that comes from the Inputs from the various people that can bid.
One of the things that I needed to do was create (I think) an empty dictionary to loop Inputs both a Key=name if person and Value=money the person bid , but within the program none should be able to see what the rest bid ,only until there are no more bidders would we see the winner and biggest bid.
Don't know how to display the max value and key from the looped but ended dictionary???! Stuck on line 27  (24/04/24)-12:11 | 23:33
